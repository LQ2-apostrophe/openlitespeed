# OpenLiteSpeed Edgy Web Server

Developed by **LQ2'** ([Website](https://www.LQ2music.com) | [Blog](https://noisystream.LQ2music.com)). Contributions are welcome.

## Description

OpenLiteSpeed is a high-performance, lightweight, open-sourced HTTP server developed and copyrighted by LiteSpeed Technologies. Users are free to download, use, distribute, and modify OpenLiteSpeed and its source code in accordance with the precepts of the GPLv3 license.

**OpenLiteSpeed Edgy** is my customized version of OpenLiteSpeed. The aim is to make this version as edgy as possible:
- Better HTTP/2 protocol support.
- Experimental QUIC protocol support.
- Wider selection of SSL ciphers.
- And up-to-date with newer web and cryptography technologies.

I hope this version will get more attention from LiteSpeed Technologies. The official repository of OpenLiteSpeed is [here](https://github.com/litespeedtech/openlitespeed).
